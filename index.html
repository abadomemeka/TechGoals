                <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
            </div>
            <div >
                <p class="goals-message">In the first two months, I will focus on applying frontend technologies during the <a
                        href="https://hng.tech/learn" data-testid="hngLink">HNG Internship</a>. I will master the fundamentals of
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building on my existing knowledge. Utilizing online resources like FreeCodeCamp and
                    Coursera, I'll learn proper syntax, structure, and best practices for building web pages. Additionally, I will
                    get comfortable with responsive design principles to ensure websites adapt to different screen sizes, providing
                    a smooth user experience for everyone. I'll also learn the basics of version control with Git, which will allow
                    me to track changes in my code, collaborate on projects, and revert to previous versions if needed. There are
                    many interactive Git tutorials available online to get me started.</p>

                <p class="goals-message">Once the internship is over, I will evaluate myself and compile all the projects I have worked on into a
                    portfolio website to showcase my skills when applying for jobs. While applying, I will continue to improve my
                    efficiency in React and learn frontend technologies such as SEO optimization, ensuring my websites rank high in
                    search results. The best way to solidify my understanding is by building small personal projects like a
                    portfolio website, a single-page application, an e-commerce application, and unique projects that make me stand
                    out. During these projects, I will focus on understanding the concept of component-based architecture, a core
                    principle in modern front-end development. This involves building reusable UI elements that can be easily
                    integrated into different parts of my application.</p>

                <p class="goals-message">The second year is all about expanding my knowledge and venturing into more advanced topics. In the first half of
                    my second year, I will deepen my understanding of JavaScript by learning advanced concepts like object-oriented
                    programming, asynchronous programming, and the DOM (Document Object Model). Additionally, I will explore using
                    CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less to manage complex stylesheets more efficiently. Another important aspect to
                    consider is front-end testing. Here, I will gain an introduction to frameworks like Jest or Mocha to write tests
                    for my code, ensuring the functionality and stability of my web applications.</p>

                <p class="goals-message">As I move into the final stretch of my roadmap, I will broaden my horizons by learning about web accessibility
                    best practices to ensure my websites are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. I will also
                    gain knowledge on performance optimization techniques using resources like <a href="https://keyword.dog"
                        data-testid="keywordLink">Keyword.Dog</a> to improve the speed and responsiveness of my websites. <a
                        href="https://scrapeanyweb.site" data-testid="scrapeanywebLink">Scrape Any Web</a> will be useful in helping
                    me test my websites. Finally, to stay ahead of the curve, I will make a habit of staying updated with industry
                        trends through blogs, meetups, and online resources.</p>
